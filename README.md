# Advent Of Code 2020

This is my attempt to complete the Advent Of Code 2020 in Golang, just for fun.
I'm not a pro at algorithms, there are probably better solutions.
All the solutions are developed using TDD.

## Test 
You can run the test suit of each day going to their directory and running
```
go test ./src
```
## Day 1
